# Unofficial-IAC23-Template

Unofficial latex template for the 2023 International Aerospace Congress. They only provided a word template, but I don't writing papers in word. I'm not a LaTeX expert, so it may be a little clumsy.Feel free to use this/correct anything wrong with it.


Used this repo as a starting point:
https://github.com/debittner/iac_latex_template

But it's 9 years old so the format has changed a little bit.

Borrowed citation styling from Elsevier's LaTeX template.
